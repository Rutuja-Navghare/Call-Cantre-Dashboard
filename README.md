# Call-Cantre-Dashboard
  In this dashboard I have used some advanced options of Power BI, some advanced DAX calculation, advanced formatting. This is a complete dynamic dashboard. There are different KPI cards used in this dashboard. 
  There are different filters used in this dashboard. Created two different dashboard such as "HOME" and the "GRID".
